Don't make changes until I explicitly say so.

This is a fork of another project, I will keep pulling new features from upstream, so try to do changes that avoid too big merge conflicts in that sense.

For now I am running the development with `pnpm run docker:dev`, and typically have that docker container running in order to serve the website locally for development purposes.

For a summary of fork-specific changes, see `FORK_NOTES.md` and keep it updated when diverging from upstream.
